# Testing Loop

When working on or fixing tests in this project, follow this loop:

1. **Run tests**  
   From repo root:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_tests_with_logs.sh
   ```

2. **Read the logs**  
   Inspect `test_logs/ur10_gz_bringup_test.log` (and, if present, `test_logs/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`, `test_logs/test_results/`) to see failures, debug output (image size, robot start/end positions), and CTest/launch_test errors.

3. **Fix the issues**  
   Change code or config based on what the logs show (e.g. timeout, exit codes, topic names, assertions).

4. **Try again**  
   Re-run `./scripts/run_tests_with_logs.sh` and re-check `test_logs/` until all tests pass.

Do not assume tests pass without re-running the script and confirming via the log files.
